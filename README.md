# DvorakX
this layout is useful for programmers

this project is a low level keyboard hooker to control mapping keys from qwerty to dvorak layout with additional programming character(s) and some functionality

the layout looks like this

![dvorakX layout](./layout.png?raw=true "layout")

# some features : 
pressing ctrl or win key the program will not map the next keys to dvorak (so no more problems with copy, paste 😍)

left alt is mapped to X key which prevents the default alt

X + caps act triggers alt

X + any not handled button will become alt (so don't worry)

right alt and right ctrl swapped

caps is ctrl+backspace (so useful😊)

life is beautiful ❤💕💖
