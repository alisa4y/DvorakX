# DvorakX
this layout is useful for programmers

this project is a low level keyboard hooker to control mapping keys from qwerty to dvorak layout with additional programming character(s) and some functionality

the layout looks like this it is set for javascript you change the key mapping in keyMaps.h pretty straight forward

![dvorakX layout](./layout.png?raw=true "layout")

# some features : 
pressing ctrl or win key the program will not map the next keys to dvorak (so no more problems with copy, paste 😍)

left alt is mapped to X key which prevents the default alt

X + caps act triggers alt

X + any not handled button will become alt (so don't worry)

right alt and right ctrl swapped

caps is ctrl+backspace (so useful😊)

X + Z will change layout back to qwerty

X + space will change layout back to dvorak

win + space will change the language and stop the key mapping (not functionalities)

X + enter will literally prints return 😁

and more ...

life is beautiful ❤💕💖
